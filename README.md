# EGM722: Project Assignment

# project
Repository for programming project egm722

# Set Up 
Before running the code, git and conda will need to be downloaded onto you computer. The instructions for installing git can be found here: and for Anaconda here: 

Now that git and conda have been installed, the repository (URL) needs to now be cloned to your computer. You can do this by opening GitHub or Git Bash. The instructions for opening via GitHub are shown below.

After the repository has been cloned, a conda environment should now be created to work through the code. This will be done by using the environment.yml file provided in this repository. To do this, open Anaconda Navigator and go to the Environments tab. From this tab, click import and search for the environment.yml file in the folder where you cloned the repository to. Give the environment a meaningful name, example: 'crimeproject'. This may take some time. 

Once this has been completed, go back to the Home tab on Anaconda Navigator and ensure that your new environment is selected instead of the deafult 'base'. You can now open jupyter notebook from this channel or open the command prompt from this environment and launch (jupyter-notebook.exe). Either route will open jupyter notebook in a webpage, which you can then navigate to your repository folder and open the NI_Crime_Project notebook to work through.
